Closure : A function which remembers its scope, lexical scope, this function remembers the scope even it was excecuted from different scope from where it declared,function remember the scope during the time of declaration, it reference the pointer or scope of variblabe and it is not like duplicating variables
set time out and set interval
settimeout has property of closures;

runtime and type error

undefined: when we declare a variable with any assignment javascript take it as undefined value

Type coersion: javascript is a flexibale on typing, it will changes its typer using == operator and all values of type will have boolean condition
Dot notation: It wont work in objects having reserved keys or number
dates:
js not work for overloading of fuctions

constructor: fun which let you populate obj the we need to create
types of object ??

1)calling standlone function directionn has this reference to Global object- global nothing but enviroment object: of run time, for windows is window and for node global
2) calling function as a property of object reference , then this object will be its object references itself 
3)calling a standlone function with new keyword it will create a new object

call() method: its a method for function and call bound this referene object?(it gives object that this reference points to)

protype is build object using blurprint

when a function is created it create a object for itself and a prototype 

Automatically created prototype object is actually created using new Object()

reverse() method work for Array for string we need to convert to array using split
reduce(): reduce(fn,start)  fn=(rev,char)=>char+rev and reduce is method of Array
var a= "abcbad";

var red = a.split("").every((char,i)=>{
  return char === a[a.length-i-1];
})
